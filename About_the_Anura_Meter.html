      <h2>About the Anura Meter</h2>
      <p>Anura Meter tracks selected manifesto promises of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake based on their alignment with key areas of public interest, relating to economic reform, governance, anti-corruption, and social protection.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Economic reform-related promises focus on investment, trade, public finance, and tax reforms.</li>
        <li>Governance-related promises address processes and systems of decision-making, coordination, and management within the government for better transparency and accountability.</li>
        <li>Anti-corruption-related promises focus on implementing systems and legal frameworks to prevent, detect, and punish corrupt practices within public institutions and government operations.</li>
        <li>Social protection-related promises refer to policies, programs, and regulatory mechanisms aimed at reducing poverty, vulnerability, and discrimination.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Tracking will rely on:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Publicly available information from official government sources</li>
        <li>Government responses to Right to Information (RTI) requests</li>
        <li>Crowd-sourced updates, verified by the Parliamentary Research Team at Verit√© Research</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The 24 promises that were selected were based on our observations on the most critical elements of the manifesto that generated high public interest.</p>
